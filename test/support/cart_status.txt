If the free gift card or free merchandise came with the purchase of multiple qualifying items, your receipt will show the amount of each item attributable to the free gift card or free merchandise, and your return will be reduced by that amount unless you return the free gift card unused or the free merchandise in resalable condition. Similarly, if purchasing an item makes you eligible for a discount on other merchandise, the amount of the discount will be deducted from the return value of the item unless you return that other merchandise as well. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You purchase a bike for $100 and receive a free $10 gift card. If you return the bike, $10 will be deducted from the refund amount and your refund amount will be $90 unless you return the free gift card unused. If you do return the free gift card, your return value will be $100.</li>\r\n\t<li>You purchase a bike for $100 and receive a free bike helmet valued at $25. If you subsequently return the bike, $25 will be deducted from the refund amount and your refund will be $75 unless you return the bike helmet unused. If you do return the bike helmet unused, your return value will be $100.</li>\r\n\t<li>The offer is &quot;buy $100 worth of board games and receive a free $10 gift card.&quot; You buy 10 items for $10 each, totaling $100. If you return one of those items without the free gift card, the amount of your refund will be $9 unless you return the free gift card unused.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you purchase a bike for $100 and buy a bike basket for 50% off of a $10 regular retail price (such that you pay $5 for the bike basket) and you return the bike, your return amount will be $95 unless you also return the bike basket. If you return the bike basket, your return value will be $105.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Store Pickup / Family &amp; Friends Pickup return policy (Buy Online, pick up in store)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Store Pickup and Family &amp; Friends Pickup orders are subject to the same return policies as purchases made online or in stores.</li>\r\n\t<li>Store Pickup orders are considered to be an Online purchase however they may ONLY be returned to a Toys&quot;R&quot;Us or Babies&quot;R&quot;Us store location for store merchandise credit\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>The Ready for pickup email is required for any store returns of merchandise made on your Store Pickup or Family &amp; Friends Pickup order</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Since you will not have a dated purchase receipt or pack slip, this&nbsp;<strong>&#39;Ready for Pickup&#39; email indicates that your order has been picked up and settled.

We have a &quot;no quibble&quot; policy when it comes to recalls. This means Toys&quot;R&quot;Us and Babies&quot;R&quot;Us stores will take back recalled products sold at a Toys&quot;R&quot;Us or Babies&quot;R&quot;Us store or our e-commerce sites at any point during the recall period. No receipt or proof of purchase is necessary to return a recalled product to one of our stores. If you do not have a receipt, you will receive a store credit for the lowest sale price of the product within the last 30 days. There are some exceptions to this policy, so be sure to check with your local store for more details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
